#  Online document sharing system concept.
The Kuching District Education Office Information Management Dashboard (KDEO Information Management Dashboard) is a comprehensive web-based solution developed to transform information management at the Kuching District Education Office. Its main goal is to provide safe document exchange across User Levels 1 and 2, doing away with the need for external platforms that can compromise data protection. Based on internet connectivity, this continuous technology enables User Level 2 access to important data online. 

The dashboard includes the Administrator, User Level 1, and User Level 2 user levels. In charge of administering User Level 1 and User Level 2 accounts, including registration, updates, removals, and role assignments, the Administrator plays an important role. Additionally, both the Administrator and User Level 1 can properly control the uploading, editing, and deleting of documents, encouraging a collaborative and efficient data-handling environment. 
Other than that, all of three user level have the access to download, upload and assigned document.
